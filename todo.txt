loading bar
add ChangePos param
clean up params (group the platform-related ones?)

	?? instead of taking a list of meshes, take a MeshFolder and automatically get the meshes?
+> unity doesn't let you shift-select a whole lot of meshes, since they're nested inside objects; you need to open each and click on each mesh before drag-and-dropping in the inspector's field. For a couple objects it's ok but have a dozen and you'll hate the world.
-> it forces users to have one folder per type though, instead of all in the same foder
+> you could use their name to only import the right ones

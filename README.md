# Unity_BackgroundElementsRandomizer

### What is it
This is a unity plugin to help manage level design in scenes with a lot of elements using different interchangeable versions of objects.

### Use cases
Basically: if you want to make a city, instead of manually changing the look of each house, you just create a few categories (houses, shops, appartment blocks), do your whole level design using the prefab of each type and the script randomizes it so the houses (and shops, and appartment blocks) are not all the same. You can switch between the final view, with each random house, and the work view, with a low-poly placeholder, to have a better overview of your level.
Or you can use it for tiles in a platformer, or anything that necessitates hand-made level design with some graphic variety.

I'm currently using unity 2019.3, but this should work well with other versions.
